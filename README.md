Some random addition for Balatro. Some assets work weirdly sometimes


## Installation

Latest version of [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods) and [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) are required. 
Can be useful to have [Talisman](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Talisman) too.
