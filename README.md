# GIGA

Some random addition for Balatro. Some assets work weirdly sometimes.


## Installation

Latest version of [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods) and [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) are required. 
Can be useful to have [Talisman](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Talisman) too.

Just download the zip file, extract it and place it in your Mod folder.


## Cross-Mod

Their is some extra asset if you have some other mods. Here is a list :
- [Cryptid](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Cryptid)

## Elements

- 28+ Jokers

- 21 Foods (+1 CrossMod)

- 4 Booster Packs

- 3+ Enhancement

- 2 Vouchers

*Some Joker has secret interaction with other Jokers.*
*A lot of assets have unfinish or just don't have art yet.*


## Additionnals Infos

If a whole asset is in comment, don't remove it from the comment. It's an idea and this may cause the game to crash.
If you have any ideas for how the mod's elements might interact, feel free to DM me on Discord (@MrYamiTsu). You can also send me artwork of the elements if you like (I'll mention you in the credit).
